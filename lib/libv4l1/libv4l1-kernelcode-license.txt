Hi, Hans. Nice to 'meet' you.

Yes, that's fine. Take what you need from my code and use it in your 
LGPL licensed library. I'm all in favor of removing v4l1 from the kernel.

Bill.

Permission granted.

Looking forward to seeing this in libv4l1 so we can kill this legacy code
in the kernel.
