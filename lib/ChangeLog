libv4l-0.5.3
------------
* When conversion requires multiple passes don't alloc the needed temporary
  buffer on the stack, as some apps (ekiga) use so much stack themselves
  this causes us to run out of stack space

libv4l-0.5.2
------------
* Add Philips SPC210NC to list of cams with upside down sensor, reported by
  Rieker Flaik
* Work around some drivers (pwc) not properly reflecting what one gets after a
  s_fmt in their try_fmt answer
* Check that s_fmt atleast gives us the width, height and pixelformat try_fmt
  promised us, and if not disable conversion
* Only check width, height and pixelformat when checking if we are doing
  conversion, instead of doing a memcmp, as that are the only things which
  the convert code checks
* Take into account that the buffers only contain half of the lines when
  field is V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE

libv4l-0.5.1
------------
* Add support for software cropping from 352x288 -> 320x240 / 176x144 ->
  160x120, so that apps which will only work with vga resolutions like
  320x240 (Skype!) will work with cams/drivers which do not support cropping
  CIF resolutions to VGA resolutions in hardware. This makes all 2.6.27 gspca
  supported cams, except for the pac7302 which only does 640x480 (and skype
  wants 320x240), work with skype
* The v4lconvert_convert function was becoming a bit of a mess, so split the
  functionailiy into separate v4lconvert_convert_pixfmt, v4lconvert_rotate and
  v4lconvert_crop functions, and make v4lconvert_convert a frontend to
  these
* Do not link the wrapper libs against libpthread (patch from Gregor Jasny)

libv4l-0.5.0
------------
* Add support for enumerating framesizes and frameintervals of emulated
  formats when the driver supports it for the real format
* Make sure the video device always gets opened RW even if the application
  asks for RO
* Add Genius E-Messenger 112 (093a:2476) to list of cams which have their
  sensor upside down

libv4l-0.4.3
------------
* Add suport for YUYV and YVYU packed pixel formats (Jean-Francois Moine)
* Prefer compressed pixformats for resolutions > 176x144

libv4l-0.4.2
------------
* The bayer pixel order in gspca's sonixb driver was different from that in
  the sn9c102 driver from the mainline kernel, a recent gspca patch fixes
  this, adjust libv4l to match (and make it work properly with the sn9c102
  driver).

libv4l-0.4.1
------------
* When the driver supports read() and we are not converting let the driver
  handle read() instead of emulating it with mmap mode
* Fix errors and warnings when compiling with ICC (Gregor Jasny)
* Add support to libv4lconvert for rotating images 90 (for Pixart 7302 cams)
  or 180 (Philips SPC200NC / Philips SPC300NC) degrees
* Add support for Pixart custom JPEG format
* Hide non public symbols (Gregor Jasny)
* Fix and enable x86_64 asm jpeg decompress helper functions (Gregor Jasny)

libv4l-0.4.0
------------
* Be more relaxed in our checks for mixing read and mmap access, we were
  being more strict in this then certain kernel drivers (bttv) making xawtv
  unhappy
* With some drivers the buffers must be mapped before queuing, so when
  converting map the (real) buffers before calling the qbuf ioctl
* Add support for conversion to RGB24 (before we only supported BGR24) based
  on a patch by Jean-Francois Moine
* When the hardware supports a format natively prefer using the native
  version over converting from another supported format
* Various Makefile and pkgconfig file improvements by Gregor Jasny (Debian)
* Drop the appl-patches dir, all application patches are now available and
  tracked here: http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Libv4l_Progress


libv4l-0.3.9
------------
* Not only see /dev/video* but also /dev/v4l/* as video devices
  (only affects libv4l1 and the wrappers) patch from Brandon Philips
* Silence the creation of the .pc files in the Makefiles (Brandon Philips)
* Part of the copyright headers refered GPL instead of LGPL due to a copy
  and paste error (Brandon Philips)


libv4l-0.3.8
------------
* work around wrong REQUEST_BUFFERS ioctl return code from certain drivers
* add pkg-config (.pc) files for easier detection if libv4l is available
* check capabilities for streaming, if the driver cannot do streaming don't
  insert ourselves between the application and the driver
* intercept get capabilites and report read capability (which we always offer)
* query buffer: indicate the mapping state of our (fake) buffer in the flags


libv4l-0.3.7
------------
* Add spca505/6 and spca508 cam specific formats (YUYV per line variations)


libv4l-0.3.6
------------
* Add missing COPYING.LIB file


libv4l-0.3.5
------------
* Make JPEG decoding more robust


libv4l-0.3.4 (the brownpaperbag release)
----------------------------------------
* The mmap64 support in 0.3.3, has caused a bug in libv4l1 when running on
  32 bit systems (who uses those now a days?), this bug caused v4l1
  compatibility to not work at all, this release fixes this
* Some apps (xawtv, kopete) use an ioctl wrapper internally for various
  reasons. This wrappers request argument is an int, but the real ioctl's
  request argument is an unsigned long. Passing the VIDIOC_xxx defines through
  to the wrapper, and then to the real ioctl, causes the request to get sign
  extended on 64 bit args. The kernel seems to ignore the upper 32 bits,
  causing the sign extension to not make a difference. libv4l now also
  ignores the upper 32 bits of the libv4lx_ioctl request argument on 64 bit
  archs
* Add a bugfix patch for kopete in the appl-patches dir, currently it assumes
  that it got the width and height it asked for when doing a S_FMT, which is a
  wrong assumption


libv4l-0.3.3
------------
* Add open64 and mmap64 wrappers to the LD_PRELOAD wrapper libs, so that
  they also work for applications compiled with FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, this
  fixes using them with v4l-info
* While looking at xawtv in general, found a few bugs in xawtv itself, added
  a patch to fix those to the appl-patches dir
* Talking about the appl-patches dir, restore that as it accidentally got
  dropped from 0.3.2
* Be more verbose in various places when it comes to logging (esp errors)
* Change v4lconvert_enum_fmt code a bit, so that it is easier to add more
  supported destination formats to libv4lconvert
* Don't return -EINVAL from try_fmt when we cannot convert because the cam
  doesn't have any formats we know. Instead just return as format whatever the
  cam returns from try_fmt, this new behavior is compliant with the v4l2
  api as documented

libv4l-0.3.2
------------
* Add support for converting from sn9c10x compressed data
* Add support for converting from pac207 compressed data
* Add "make install" Makefile target

libv4l-0.3.1
------------
* Only serialize V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE type ioctls
* Do not return an uninitialized variable as result code for GPICT
  (fixes vlc, but see below)
* Add an apps-patches directory which includes:
  * vlc-0.8.6-libv4l1.patch, modify vlc's v4l1 plugin to directly call into
    libv4l1, in the end we want all apps todo this as its better then
    LD_PRELOAD tricks, but for vlc this is needed as vlc's plugin system
    causes LD_PRELOAD to not work on symbols in the plugins
  * camorama-0.19-fixes.patch, small bugfixes to camorama's v4l1 support,
    this patch only fixes _real_ bugs in camorama and does not change it to
    work with v4l1compat. Although it does work better with these bugs fixed
    :) With this patch and LD_PRELOAD=<path>/v4l1compat.so it works
    flawless.


libv4l-0.3
----------
* add extern "C" magic to public header files for c++ usage (Gregor Jasny)
* Make libv4l1 and libv4l2 multithread use safe, see README.multi-threading
* Add v4lx_dup() calls (and intercept dup() from the wrappers) this fixes
  use with gstreamer's v4l2 plugin (tested with cheese)
* Hopefully definitely fix compile errors on systems with a broken videodev2.h

libv4l-0.2
----------
*** API change ***
* Change v4lconvert api so that the v4lconvert struct always gets allocated
  by the library, this to make it opaque, so that we can avoid future API
  and ABI changes
* Add support for yuv420 -> bgr24 conversion
* When converting from v4l2 pixelformat to v4l12 palette return
  VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P instead of VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420 for
  V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420 as that is what most apps seem to expect
* override kernel v4l1 compat min / max size with our own more accurate values
* fix v4l1 munmap bug where it didn't recognise the buffer being unmapped was
  our fake buffer (fixes gstreamer v4l1 support, checked with cheese)
* add support for reporting the emulated pixelformats with ENUM_FMT, this
  defaults to off, and can be activated by passing a flag to enable it to
  v4l2_fd_open. This gets enabled by default the wrappers.
* v4l2: mmap the real device buffers before doing conversion when DQBUF gets
  called before the application has called mmap (avoid crash).


libv4l-0.1
----------
* major shuffle / rewrite now split into libv4l1, libv4l2, libv4lconvert
  and 2 wrappers for binary compatibility
* rewritten LGPL bayer decoding
* many many other changes and fixes


v4l1-compat-0.6 (V4L2 apps stay working)
----------------------------------------
* Do not go into emulation mode of rgb24 immediately, but only after a
  GPICT ioctl which has not been preceded by a SPICT ioctl, AKA do not get
  in the way of V4L2 read calls by doing conversion on them
* Do not get in the way of mmap calls made by V4L2 applications
* Fix swapping of red and blue in bayer -> bgr24 decode routine
* Remember the v4l1 palette asked for with SPICT and return that, as
  otherwise we loose information when going v4l1 -> v4l2 -> v4l1, for example
  YUV420P becomes YUV420, which are separate in v4l1.


v4l1-compat-0.5 (perfect camorama)
----------------------------------
* Allow changing of format after the buffers have been mapped, by tearing
  down the entire house, changing the fundament and then rebuilding it.
  Now changing the capture resolution in camorama works!
* Fix jpeg decoding error reporting
* Allow jpeg's with a height which is a multiple of 8 (was 16)
* Remove a number of pretty new VIDIOCXXX -> string mappings from log.c,
  fixing compiling with somewhat older kernels


v4l1-compat 0.4
---------------
* Do not even try to change the format in v4l1_compat_set_format(), unless
  _really_ necessary.
* Cleanup ambigious use of src_format (no functional changes)
* Drop the mmap hack for zerocopy access under certain conditions, one of them
  that the cam can deliver the requested format. Although avoiding the
  memcpy in this scenarios is a good thing todo, there were several issues
  with the 0.3 implementation of this, fixing all these means adding lots of
  special cases all over the code. So instead we just drop support and
  always do atleast a memcpy (or a conversion). If an application cannot
  live with the speed penalty this imposes it should be ported to v4l2.
* Now that we've gotten rid of the zerocopy mmap hack, we can safely allow
  mixing read and mmap based IO.
* Explictly include linux/ioctl.h, to fix compile with kernel headers where
  linux/videodev.h doesn't.


v4l1-compat 0.3
---------------
* Don't allow multiple opens, in theory our code can handle it, but not all
  v4l2 devices like it (ekiga does it and uvc doesn't like it).


v4l1-compat 0.2
---------------
* When mmap gets passed an fd of -1 (anonymous map) don't look for it in our
  list of managed fds, as we use -1 to mark unused entries (fixes ekiga
  crashing). Also check for an fd of -1 in the other calls we intercept.
* In close() start with removing the fd from our list of managed fds, this must
  be done first, because as soon as we've done the actual close syscall, the
  fd maybe returned by an open in another thread and we don't want to intercept
  calls to this new fd.
* Make unknown v4l1 palette types a normal level log messages instead of an
  error.
* When an applicaiton changes the width / height through the CMCAPTURE ioctl
  remember the new width and height.
* If the devices initial v4l2 pixformat has no corresponding v4l1 palette, try
  setting a format which does (and which we emulate when necessary) so that
  applicactions which just query the current format (GPICT) and then take
  whatever they get will work (partially fixes camorama)
* Implement our own SWIN instead of using kernel compat layer, for more
  flexibility and better error checking


v4l1-compat 0.1
---------------
* Initial public release.
