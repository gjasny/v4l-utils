This test directory contains some special test EDIDs:

Three test files to check the edid-decode file parser:

quantumdata.test: an EDID as generated by the QuantumData (nowadays
	Teledyne LeCroy) software.

xorg.test: an EDID as logged by xorg in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.

xrandr.test: an EDID as reported by 'xrandr --props'.


Six hand-crafted EDIDs to test rarely seen EDID extensions or data blocks:

cta-vesa.test: has VESA Display Transfer Characteristics Data Block and
	VESA Video Display Device Data Block in the CTA-861 block.

ls-ext.test: has a Localized String Extension Block using UTF 8.
ls-ext16.test: has a Localized String Extension Block using UTF 16BE.
ls-ext32.test: has a Localized String Extension Block using UTF 32BE.

blockmap-128.test: has a single Block Map extension and a total of
	128 blocks.

blockmap-255.test: has two Block Map extensions and a total of
	255 blocks (the maximum possible EDID size when the second
	Block Map is used).

256-blocks.test: has the maximum number of 256 blocks.

cta-timings.test: contains various DisplayID and OVT timings in the
	CTA Extension Block.

cta-vfpdb.test: use to test correct VFPDB parsing. This EDID has a
	1080p60 DTD 1 in Block 0, and a 1280p60 DTD 2 and 2560x1440p60 DTD 3 in
	Block 3. The Video Format Preference Data Block says DTD 2.

	If the display driver selects 1080p60, then the driver does not
	support the VFPDB. If it selects 1280p60, then it supports the
	VFPDB correctly. If it selects 2560x1440p60, then it supports the
	VFPDB incorrectly, ignoring DTDs in Block 0.

cta-eeodb.test: contains an HDMI Forum EDID Extension Override Data Block


Examples of old EDID versions:

edid-1.X.test: EDIDs with version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.


Test EDIDs from several standards:

cta-annex-a.test
cta-annex-d.test
vesa-edid-1.1.test
vesa-edid-1.3.test
vesa-edid-1.4-1.test
vesa-edid-1.4-2.test
vesa-edid-1.4-3.test

One special Fixed-length DisplayID example from the DisplayID 2.1a standard,
this can't (yet?) be parsed by edid-decode, and I have yet to see a real
DisplayID example (i.e. as a replacement for the EDID) in the wild, but
it is useful to add it to the list of test 'EDIDs':

vesa-displayid-fixed-length.test

This EDID contains the DisplayID ARVR_HDM and ARVR_Layer Data Blocks:

test/vesa-displayid-arvr.test

InfoFrame examples can be found in the 'if' directory.
ELD examples can be found in the 'eld' directory.
