.SH NAME
cec-compliance - An application to verify remote CEC devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cec-compliance
[\fI-h\fR] [\fI-d <dev>\fR] [other options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cec-compliance utility can be used to test how well remote CEC devices
comply with the CEC specification. It can also be used to test the local
CEC adapter (with the \fI-A\fR option).

By default it will run through all tests, but if one or more of the feature
test options is given, then only those tests will be performed. A set of core
tests is always run.

The CEC adapter needs to be configured before it is used to run tests with
\fBcec-compliance\fR. Use \fBcec-ctl\fR for configuration.

If the CEC adapter has claimed several logical addresses, the test set is run
from each logical address in succession. The remote device needs to report a
valid physical address in order to run tests on it.

When running compliance tests, \fBcec-follower\fR should be run on the same
adapter. \fBcec-follower\fR will reply to messages that are not handled by
\fBcec-compliance\fR. \fBcec-follower\fR will also monitor the device under test
for behaviors that are not compliant with the specification. Before each test-run
\fBcec-follower\fR should be restarted if it is already running, to initialize
the emulated device with a clean and known initial state.

Some tests require interactive mode (with the \fI-i\fR option) to confirm that
the test passed. When in interactive mode, the user is asked to observe or
perform actions on the remote device. Some tests also give conclusive test
results when run in interactive mode.

When testing the local CEC adapter's compliance with the CEC API, there must be
at least one remote device present in order to test transmitting and receiving.

The compliance tests can have several possible outcomes besides passing and
failing:

    OK                  The test passed.

    OK (Unexpected)     The test passed, but it was unexpected for the device
                        under test to support it. This might for example occur
                        when a TV replies to messages in the Deck Control
                        feature.

    OK (Not Supported)  The feature that was tested is not supported by the
                        device under test, and that feature was not mandatory for
                        the device to pass.

    OK (Presumed)       Nothing went wrong during the test, but the test cannot
                        positively verify that the required effects of the test
                        occured. The test runner should verify that the test
                        passed by manually observing the device under test. This
                        is typically the test result for tests that send
                        messages that are not replied to, but which induce some
                        side effect on the device under test, such as a TV
                        switching to another input or sending a Remote Control
                        command.

    OK (Refused)        The device supports the feature or message being tested,
                        but responded <Feature Abort> ["Refused"] to indicate
                        that it cannot perform the given operation. This might
                        for example occur when trying to test the One Touch
                        Record feature on a TV with copy protection enabled.

    FAIL                The test failed and was expected to pass on the device.

Some tests depend on other tests being successful. These are not run if the
tests they depend on failed, and they will not be shown in the test listing.

.SH EXAMPLE
We want to test the compliance of a TV when it is interacting with a Playback
device. The device node of the CEC adapter which the TV is connected to is
/dev/cec1.

The local CEC adapter first needs to be configured as a Playback device, and it
must have an appropriate physical address. It is important that the physical
address is correct, so as to not confuse the device under test. For example, if
the CEC adapter is connected to the first input of the TV, the physical address
1.0.0.0 should generally be used.

    cec-ctl -d1 --playback --phys-addr 1.0.0.0

Most CEC adapters will automatically detect the physical address, and for those
adapters the \fI--phys-addr\fR option is not needed.

Next, \fBcec-follower\fR also has to be started on the same device:

    cec-follower -d1

\fBcec-compliance\fR can now be run towards the TV by supplying the \fI-r\fR
option with the logical address 0:

    cec-compliance -d1 -r0
