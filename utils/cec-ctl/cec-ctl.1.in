.SH NAME
cec-ctl - An application to control cec devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cec-ctl
[\fI\-h\fR] [\fI\-d <dev>\fR] [many other options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cec-ctl tool is used to control cec devices. It is able to control almost
any aspect of such devices covering the full CEC API.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR \fI<dev>\fR
Use device <dev> as the CEC device. If <dev> is a number, then /dev/cec<dev> is used.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Turn on verbose reporting.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wall\-clock\fR
Show timestamps as wall-clock time. This also turns on verbose reporting. 
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints the help message.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-phys\-addr\fR \fI<addr>\fR
Use this physical address. The address can be a number (e.g. 0 or 0x11b1)
or formatted as a.b.c.d where each component is a hex value from 0-f
(e.g. 0.0.0.0 or 1.1.b.1).
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-osd\-name\fR \fI<name>\fR
Use this OSD name. The maximum length is 14 characters.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-vendor\-id\fR \fI<id>\fR
Use this vendor ID. The vendor ID is a number from 0x0 to 0xffffff.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-logical\-address\fR
Show first configured logical address or nothing if the device is unconfigured.
Useful for scripts, e.g.: la=`cec-ctl -s -l`
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-logical\-addresses\fR
Show all configured logical addresses or nothing if the device is unconfigured.
Useful for scripts, e.g.: las=`cec-ctl -s -L`
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clear all logical addresses, leaving the CEC device unconfigured.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-reply\fR
By default when sending a CEC message that expects a reply this utility will
wait for that reply. With this option it will just send it without waiting
for the reply. This option applies to the messages following this option.
It acts as a toggle, so after you specify it a second time then the following
messages will wait for a reply again. 
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-non\-blocking\fR
Transmit messages in non-blocking mode.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-to\fR \fI<la>\fR
Send the message to the given logical address (0-15).
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-from\fR \fI<la>\fR
Send message from the given logical address. It is only necessary to use this
option if multiple logical addresses are claimed. By default the first assigned
logical address will be used.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-show\-raw\fR
Show the raw CEC message in hex.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-info\fR
Skip the Driver Info output section.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-show\-topology\fR
Show the CEC topology, detecting which other CEC devices are on the CEC bus.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-poll\fR
Send a poll message.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-trace\fR
Trace all called ioctls. Useful for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-\-cec\-version\-1.4\fR
Use CEC Version 1.4 instead of 2.0 (the default).
.TP
\fB\-\-allow\-unreg\-fallback\fR
Allow fallback to Unregistered if all logical addresses are claimed.
By default the adapter will remain unconfigured.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-rc\-passthrough\fR
Disable the RC passthrough. By default remote control CEC messages are
passed on as input keystrokes (the \fBCEC_LOG_ADDRS_FL_ALLOW_RC_PASSTHRU\fR
flag is set when calling the \fBCEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS\fR ioctl), but this
can be blocked by using this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-reply\-to\-followers\fR
The reply will be sent to followers as well. By default the reply will only
go to the follower that initiated the CEC message. But if you have other
followers running as well, then by giving this option they will also receive
the reply.
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fI<ms>\fR
Set the reply timeout in milliseconds (default is 1000 ms).
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-ui\-commands\fR

\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-monitor\fR
Start monitoring CEC traffic. This will monitor broadcast messages,

CEC adapter. Directed messages between other CEC devices are not
monitored. This option requires root.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-monitor\-all\fR

"all" can be used for <la> or <opcode> to match all logical addresses or opcodes.
To ignore poll messages use "poll" as <opcode>.
.TP
\fB\-\-store\-pin\fR \fI<to>\fR

via the \fB\-\-analyze\-pin\fR option. Use \- to write to stdout instead of to a file.
.TP
\fB\-\-analyze\-pin\fR \fI<from>\fR
Read and analyze the CEC pin events from the given file. Use \- to read from stdin
