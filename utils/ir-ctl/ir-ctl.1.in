.SH DESCRIPTION
ir\-ctl is a tool that allows one to list the features of a lirc device,
set its options, receive raw IR, send raw IR or send complete IR scancodes.
.PP
Note: You need to have read or write permissions on the /dev/lirc device
for options to work.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR=\fIDEV\fR
lirc device to control, /dev/lirc0 by default
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-features\fR
List the features of the lirc device.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-receive\fR=[\fIFILE\fR]
Receive IR and print to standard output if no file is specified, else
save to the filename.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-send\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Send IR in text file. It must be in the format described below. If this
option is specified multiple times, send all files in\-order with a 125ms gap
between them. The gap length can be modified with \fB\-\-gap\fR.
.TP
\fB-S\fR, \fB\-\-scancode\fR=\fIPROTOCOL:SCANCODE\fR
Send the IR scancode in the protocol specified. The protocol must one of the
protocols listed below, followed by a colon and the scancode number. If this
option is specified multiple times, send all scancodes in\-order with a 125ms
gap between them. The gap length can be modified with \fB\-\-gap\fR.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-oneshot\fR
When receiving, stop receiving after the first message, i.e. after a space or
timeout of more than 19ms is received.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wideband\fR
Use the wideband receiver if available on the hardware. This is also
known as learning mode. The measurements should be more precise and any
carrier frequency should be accepted.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no-wideband\fR
Switches back to the normal, narrowband receiver if the wideband receiver
was enabled.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-carrier-range\fR=\fIRANGE\fR
Set the accepted carrier range for the narrowband receiver. It should be
specified in the form \fI30000-50000\fR.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-measure\-carrier\fR
If the hardware supports it, report what the carrier frequency is on
receiving. You will get the keyword \fIcarrier\fR followed by the frequency.
This might use the wideband receiver although this is hardware specific.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-no\-measure\-carrier\fR
Disable reporting of the carrier frequency. This should make it possible
to use the narrowband receiver. This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR
Set the length of a space at which the receiver goes idle, specified in
microseconds.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-carrier\fR=\fICARRIER\fR
Sets the send carrier frequency.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-duty\-cycle\fR=\fIDUTY\fR
Set the duty cycle for sending in percent if the hardware support it.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-emitters\fR=\fIEMITTERS\fR
Comma separated list of emitters to use for sending. The first emitter is
number 1. Some devices only support enabling one emitter (the winbond-cir
driver).
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gap\fR=\fIGAP\fR
Set the gap between scancodes or the gap between files when multiple files
are specified on the command line. The default is 125000 microseconds.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints the help message
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Verbose output; this prints the IR before sending.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the v4l2\-utils version
.PP
.SS Format of pulse and space file
When sending IR, the format of the file should be as follows. A comment
start with #. The carrier frequency can be specified as:
.PP
	carrier 38000
.PP
The file should contain alternating lines with pulse and space, followed
by length in microseconds. The following is a rc-5 encoded message:
.PP
	carrier 36000
.br
	pulse 940
.br
	space 860
.br
	pulse 1790
.br
	space 1750
.br
	pulse 880
.br
	space 880
.br
	pulse 900
.br
	space 890
.br
	pulse 870
.br
	space 900
.br
	pulse 1750
.br
	space 900
.br
	pulse 890
.br
	space 910
.br
	pulse 840
.br
	space 920
.br
	pulse 870
.br
	space 920
.br
	pulse 840
.br
	space 920
.br
	pulse 870
.br
	space 1810
.br
	pulse 840
.PP
Rather than specifying the raw IR, you can also specify the scancode and
protocol you want to send. This will also automatically set the correct
carrier. The above can be written as:
.PP
	scancode rc5:0x1e01
.PP
If multiple scancodes are specified in a file, a gap is inserted between
scancodes if there is no space between then (see \fB\-\-gap\fR). One file
can only have one carrier frequency, so this might cause problems
if different protocols are specified in one file if they use different
carrier frequencies.
.PP
Note that there are device-specific limits of how much IR can be sent
at a time. This can be both the length of the IR and the number of
different lengths of space and pulse.
.PP
.SS Supported Protocols
A scancode with protocol can be specified on the command line or in the
pulse and space file. The following protocols are supported:
\fBrc5\fR, \fBrc5x_20\fR, \fBrc5_sz\fR, \fBjvc\fR, \fBsony12\fR,
\fBsony\fB15\fR, \fBsony20\fR, \fBnec\fR, \fBnecx\fR, \fBnec32\fR,
\fBsanyo\fR, \fBrc6_0\fR, \fBrc6_6a_20\fR, \fBrc6_6a_24\fR, \fBrc6_6a_32\fR,
\fBrc6_mce\fR, \fBsharp\fR.
If the scancode starts with 0x it will be interpreted as a
hexadecimal number, and if it starts with 0 it will be interpreted as an
octal number.
.PP
.SS Wideband and narrowband receiver
Most IR receivers have a narrowband and wideband receiver. The narrowband
receiver can receive over longer distances (usually around 10 metres without
interference) and is limited to certain carrier frequencies.
.PP
The wideband receiver is for higher precision measurements and when the
carrier frequency is unknown; however it only works over very short
distances (about 5 centimetres). This is also known as \fBlearning mode\fR.
.PP
For most drivers, enabling \fBcarrier reports\fR using \fB\-m\fR also enables
the wideband receiver.
.SS Global state
All the options which can be set for lirc devices are maintained until
the device is powered down or a new option is set.
.SH EXIT STATUS
On success, it returns 0. Otherwise, it will return the error code.
.SH EXAMPLES
To list all capabilities of /dev/lirc2:
.br
	\fBir\-ctl \-f \-d /dev/lirc2\fR
.PP
To show the IR of the first button press on a remote in learning mode:
.br
	\fBir\-ctl \-r \-m \-w\fR
.PP
Note that \fBir\-ctl \-rmw\fR would receive to a file called \fBmw\fR.
.PP
To restore the normal (longer distance) receiver:
.br
	\fBir\-ctl \-n \-M\fR
.PP
To send the pulse and space file \fBplay\fR on emitter 3:
.br
	\fBir\-ctl \-e 3 \-\-send=play\fR
.PP
To send the rc-5 hauppauge '1' scancode:
.br
	\fBir\-ctl \-S rc5:0x1e01
