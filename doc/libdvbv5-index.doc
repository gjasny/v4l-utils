@section intro Introduction

This is a library that provides access to DVB adapter cards using the
Linux DVB API version 5, as defined at
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/dvbapi.html.

It also provides backward compatibility to a a driver that supports only the
legacy DVBv3 API.

@note	The DVBv3 API was deprecated at the Linux Kernel. Any Kernel since
	version 3.3 supports the DVBv5 API.

The DVBv3 API was replaced because its support is limited to just 4
standards, without covering their innovations: ATSC, DVB-C, DVB-T and
DVB-S.

The DVBv5 API was originally introduced to support DVB-S2 (also called as
DVB S2API, at the time it was merged), and were designed in a way that it
can easily support any newer standards. So, extensions were added to support
other standards, like ATSC-MH, DVB-T2, DVB-S2, ISDB, CMDB, etc.

Most of those standards are supported by libdvbv5.

As the libdvbv5 API is maintained by the same people that maintains the
Linux DVB drivers, and it is used as the reference library, together with
the dvbv5 applications, all new improvements at the Linux DVB API gets merged,
the corresponding support at libdvbv5 is also included.

@section feature Features provided by libdvbv5

The libdvbv5 provides the following features:

- It uses the latest DVBv5 API speck to talk with the Digital TV devices on
  Linux, falling back to older versions of it, up to the latest version of
  the DVBv3 API;

- It supports several Satellite Equipment Control (SEC) types and systems;

- It supports SCR/Unicable setups for Satellite;

- It supports several DiSEqC satellite system configurations;

- It provides a standard way to scan for DVB channels for several different
  types of standards: DVB-S, DVB-S2, DVB-S Turbo, DVB-C DVB-T, DVB-T2, ATSC
  and ISDB-T;

- It is flexible enough to be extended to support newer standards and newer
  features;

- It provides a way to activate/deactivate the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) on
  devices that support such feature;

- It parses the MPEG-TS main tables found on Digital TV systems, like
  PAT, PMT, SDT, TVCT, CVCT, NIT, EIT, MGT and CAT;

- Provides enhanced statistics indication about the Quality of Service
  provided by a tuned transponder.

@section dvbv5_intro Introduction to DVBv5 key value properties

@subsection dvbv5_props DVBv5 and libdvbv5 properties

The deprecated DVBv3 frontend API used to declare an union that contains 4
structs inside, one for each of the supported standards (ATSC and DVB-T/C/S).

This gives no flexibility to extend, as adding more structs at the union
would change the size of the struct, breaking the Kernelspace to userspace
API, and causing all DVB applications to break.

So, instead of keeping using this approach, the DVBv5 API came with a
different way: it passes a series of values using key/value properties.

Those values feed a in-Kernel cache. There are two special properties:
- DTV_CLEAR - clears the Kernel cache
- DTV_TUNE - sends the cache for the DTV driver to tune into a transponder.

See http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/FE_GET_SET_PROPERTY.html for
more details.

The same way as DVBv5, the libdvbv5 API also works with a set of key/value
properties.

Inside libdvbv5, there are two types of properties:

- The ones defined at the Kernel's frontent API, that are found at
  /usr/include/linux/dvb/frontend.h (actually, it uses a local copy
  of that file, stored at ./include/linux/dvb/frontend.h);

- Some extra properties used by libdvbv5. Those can be found at
  lib/include/libdvbv5/dvb-v5-std.h and start at DTV_USER_COMMAND_START.

Those extra properties allow to control other parameters that are visible
only on userspace, like the Service ID that will be used, and the corresponding
audio and video program IDs.

@subsection dvbv5_stats DVBv5 and libdvbv5 statistics

Just like what happens with DVBv3 frontend setting, the statistics provided
by DVBv3 has several issues.

On DVBv3, there are a number of special ioctls designed to get the
statistics from a DTV device.

Those DVBv3 statistics are not flexible, and they lack the scales that
are provided by each call. So, for example, a FE_READ_SNR ioctl returns
a number from 0 to 65535, but there's no way to know if this number is
a value in dB (or a submultiple) or if it is just a relative quality number
related to the Signal/Noise ratio.

Also, some delivery systems like ISDB provide up to 4 statistics for each
parameter, because it allows to set different modulation parameters to the
several different layers of the stream.

Starting with DVBv5 version 5.10 (added on Kernel 3.8), there's now a new
mechanism to retrieve the statistics. This mechanism provides a way to
discover the scale used internally by the Kernel, allowing the userspace
applications to properly present the statistics.

It also allows to obtain per-layer statistics, plus a global ponderated
mean statistics for the transponder as a whole, on standards like ISDB.

Just like the DTV properties, the stats are cached. That warrants that
all stats are got at the same time, when dvb_fe_get_stats() is called.
The Kernel drivers internally also warrant that those stats are also
obtained for the same period of time, making them more coherent.

The libdvbv5 automatically detects if the Digital TV driver in usage
provides the DVBv5 version 5.10 statistics mechanism. If it doesn't,
it falls back to DVBv3 way.

If DVB version 5.10 is supported, it also provides an extra Quality of
service indicator that tells if a received transponder has Poor, OK or
Good quality.

@page dvbv5-tools DVBv5 Tools
@brief Set of DVBv5 tools, bundled together with libdvbv5

DVBv5 Tools  is a small set of command line utilities that was developed
to be compliant with the newer features provided by version 5 of the DVB API.
The tools should also be backward compatible with the older v3 DVB API.
They were written using libdvbv5.

It is composed of 4 tools:

- dvbv5-scan - Scans the channel transponders and gets the services available
  there;
- dvbv5-zap - Locks into a channel (zap), allowing other applications to get
  the stream at the dvr devices or to monitor the stream;
- dvb-fe-tool - Lists frontend properties and allow to manually set the DVB
  frontend
- dvb-format-convert - Converts from/to other formats used by DVBv3 apps into
  the dvbv5 format.

The DVBv5 default file format is formed by a channel name, followed by a series
of key/value properties. Those tools also support the legacy formats used by
dvb-apps.

For example, this is a channel file with one DVB-C channel on it:
@code{.unparsed}
[CHANNEL]
	DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
	FREQUENCY = 573000000
	SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
	INNER_FEC = NONE
	MODULATION = QAM/256
	INVERSION = AUTO
@endcode
And this is (part of) a service (zap) file, produced from the above channel
definition using dvbv5-scan:

@code{.unparsed}
[SBT]
	SERVICE_ID = 4
	VIDEO_PID = 42
	AUDIO_PID = 257
	PID_f1 = 768
	FREQUENCY = 573000000
	MODULATION = QAM/256
	INVERSION = AUTO
	SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
	INNER_FEC = NONE
	DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A

[TNT]
	SERVICE_ID = 48
	VIDEO_PID = 336
	AUDIO_PID = 337 338 849
	PID_86 = 816
	FREQUENCY = 573000000
	MODULATION = QAM/256
	INVERSION = AUTO
	SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
	INNER_FEC = NONE
	DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
